# astar-assessment
Repository for assessment for a*star bii project.


The tasks for the assignment are completed as follows:
1. Visualize the images and annotations. Show some sample images and annotations.

python3 visualize.py


2. Implement and compare two deep learning models for the detection and classification
of keyframes using PyTorch package[2].

python3 modelling.py

3. You may use existing deep learning models, however, modifications to the model
architectures must be carried out.

Explained in code modelling.py

4. Arrange the dataset for experiments to train and test the deep learning models.

python3 prepareDataset.py

5. Please kindly provide explanations for any decisions made either directly within the
code or in the submitted code documentation

Explained in code itself

6. Submitted code documentation should include relevant metrics to evaluate the model
performance, etc

Included in modelling.py
